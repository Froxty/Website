    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Luis Fernandez. I'm currently a student studying at FGCU trying to get my B.S in Software Engineering.
        I was born in Miami and moved to Cape Coral in 2000 where I've been living here till the present. Just to tell you a little
        about myself I'm a huge gaming nerd it's been my hobby since, I was little.I play most everything 
        Moba/MMOs/FPS/Card/Strategy/RTS I started on console when I was really young and transitioned into PC where I do most if not
        all my gaming. My dad introducted me to computers really young. I remember him showing me the basic of dos and getting a new
        computer with windows 95.I would love to learn to navigate it as kid I became extremely fascinated with computers. I remember 
        taking them apart and reassembling them always trying to learn a little more. I remember getting a crappy emachine as my first
        computer I would always save my money and slowly aquire better and better computer hardware. The passion obviously carried out
         my adult life even to the present. Naturally I want to go something into the computer field. I decided I want to pursue
        a career in software engineering. Outside of school I would like to pursue a mechanical knowledge as well.</p>
